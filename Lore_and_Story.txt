>Main story
Simply become champion, stopping an evil team along the way. The evil team could be similar to Team Rocket in ideology, only caring about money, and could be running smuggling operations out of the equivalent of Chicago. Pokemon they could use includes:
Ekans/Arbok-R
Murkrow/Honchkrow
Rattatta/Raticate
Grimer/Muk
Koffing/Weezing
Spinarak/Ariados
Snubbull/Granbull
Dustox
Seedot/Nuzleaf/Shiftry
Corphish/Crawdaunt
Stunky/Skuntank
Scraggy/Scrafty
Deerling/Sawsbuck
Skrelp/Dragalge
Salandit/Salazzle
Passimian/Passimian-R

Along the way, the player hears/reads glimpses of information about a "mysterious deer" and a "stupid grunt" being blamed for causing the team's problems.

>Post game
Mention the "mysterious deer" to the professor to learn about Xerneas and track it down. Learn that it is giving off too much life-giving aura and track down the lake guardians to create a green chain with an aura break effect to calm down Xerneas and capture it.

>Other tidbits
Marshadow can be found in the main game in the equivalent of Chicago as an homage to Muhammad Ali. It is the mascot of a boxing company there and the only way to earn it is to win a battle challenge. (This company could be the equivalent of the battle tower/subway/etc.)
