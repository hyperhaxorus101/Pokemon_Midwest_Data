A file where I list possible Pokemon to remove from the dex. (The "weakest links" persay)

>Lapras
I could have sworn Michigan had its own version of Nessie, but I cannot remember. Outside of that, Lapras doesn't have much of a conncetion to the region.

>Smoochum and Jynx
Humanoid Pokemon feel fitting and more Psychic types are welcome but Jynx feels like it is very loosely connected to the region.

>Swablu and Altaria
Lots of birds exist in the region and Dragon types are welcome, but outside of this this line doesn't feel very connected to the region.

>Tympole, Palpitoad, and Seismitoad
A few other frog mons are already present and there are also two other Water/Ground lines as well.

>Elgyem, Beheeyem
Feel less connected to the region than if it were based off of say, Nevada. The region does still have a few alien stories though.

>Skrelp, Dragalge
Plenty of kelp/seaweed in a lot of the lakes and Dragon types are always welcome but the link here feels weak outside of that.

>Wyrdeer, Ursaluna, Basculegion
May want to be removed for lore reasons, but I still think their pre-evolved forms should stay.
